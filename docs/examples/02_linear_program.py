    # Linear Program

    A linear program is an optimization problem with a linear objective and affine
    inequality constraints. A common standard form is the following:

    \[
        \begin{array}{ll}
        \text{minimize}   & c^Tx \\
        \text{subject to} & Ax \leq b.
        \end{array}
    \]

    Here $A \in \mathcal{R}^{m \times n}$, $b \in \mathcal{R}^m$, and $c \in \mathcal{R}^n$ are problem data and $x \in \mathcal{R}^{n}$ is the optimization variable. The inequality constraint $Ax \leq b$ is elementwise.

    For example, we might have $n$ different products, each constructed out of $m$ components. Each entry $A_{ij}$ is the amount of component $i$ required to build one unit of product $j$. Each entry $b_i$ is the total amount of component $i$ available. We lose $c_j$ for each unit of product $j$ ($c_j < 0$ indicates profit). Our goal then is to choose how many units of each product $j$ to make, $x_j$, in order to minimize loss without exceeding our budget for any component.

    In addition to a solution $x^\star$, we obtain a dual solution $\lambda^\star$. A positive entry $\lambda^\star_i$ indicates that the constraint $a_i^Tx \leq b_i$ holds with equality for $x^\star$ and suggests that changing $b_i$ would change the optimal value.

    **Why linear programming?** Linear programming is a way to achieve an optimal outcome, such as maximum utility or lowest cost, subject to a linear objective function and affine constraints. Developed in the 20th century, linear programming is widely used today to solve problems in resource allocation, scheduling, transportation, and more. The discovery of polynomial-time algorithms to solve linear programs was of tremendous worldwide importance and entered the public discourse, even making the front page of the New York Times.

    In the late 20th and early 21st century, researchers generalized linear programming to a much wider class of problems called convex optimization problems. Nearly all convex optimization problems can be solved efficiently and reliably, and even more difficult problems are readily solved by a sequence of convex optimization problems. Today, convex optimization is used to fit machine learning models, land rockets in real-time at SpaceX, plan trajectories for self-driving cars at Waymo, execute many billions of dollars of financial trades a day, and much more.

    This marimo learn course uses CVXPY, a modeling language for convex optimization problems developed originally at Stanford, to construct and solve convex programs.
